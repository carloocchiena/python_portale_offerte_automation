# python_portale_offerte_automation
An automation to scrape data into the Portale Offerte website and get an updated list of energy and gas offering without having to deal with dozens of manual data entry

### Update 2022
A colleague of mine asked about this script and asked for some more functionality (the option to download the annual cost of the energy supply as well).<br>
I took the opportunity then to update the whole script up to Selenium 4.0 best practice and add that function.

Please be so kind to star or fork if you want to use it :)
